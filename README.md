# Crack Segmentation

Pre-trained deep learning model for crack segmentation in images of historic churches, developed within the research project <a href=https://aidabim.dieti.unina.it/>AIDaBIM – Artificial Intelligence to assess structural/seismic Damage to historic heritage in a BIM environment</a><br>
This repository provides a ready-to-use solution for crack segmentation in images of historic churches, including:
<ul>
  <li>a pre-trained deep learning model,</li>
  <li>the reference dataset used for training/validation,</li>
  <li>a minimal example code to perform inference.</li>
</ul>

This repository is intended for research, evaluation, and demonstration purposes. The provided model and dataset are not meant for safety-critical or operational structural assessments.
